## About Me  

I am **Siman Giri**, a lecturer and researcher in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, with a primary interest in the **theoretical foundations** of AI.  

My work explores the mathematical and conceptual underpinnings of machine learning, while also connecting theory with applications in teaching and research.  

This website is a space where I share my academic activities, including **research updates**, **teaching resources**, and ongoing projects.  

The site is currently under construction and will expand gradually as I continue to build it.  

For now, you can reach me at **simangiri@gmail.com**.
